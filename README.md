# InsightEdge-Power-Bi-Dashboard
This project used raw retail sales data to build an interactive Power BI dashboard. It shows key sales insights across customers, products, discounts, regions, and salespeople. SQL was used to prepare the data, and Power BI (with DAX and smart UI elements) was used to design the final dashboard.
